Lyrics to the song The Fall of Mr Fifths by the band Why?
Just another Sunday
Paddle-boat ride
on a man-made lake
with another lady stranger.
If I remain lost and die on a cross,
at least I wasn't born in a manger.
I can sense, somewhere right
now I'm being prayed for.
Seems like I always arrive
at the same shore
from where my sails set
maybe with one less lady
than my vessel left with.
Is that a threat?

Oh, I've stayed scarce
this past year, yes.
But be assured in unrest:
I'm unavoidable, like death
this Christmas. Is this twisted?
Why be upset? I never said I
didn't have syphilis,
Miss Listless -- Hard like the
bricks I pound my fists with.
I mean, she's hard like the bricks
that I pound with my fists.
This is "The fall of Mr. Fifths,
forged for the hordes
and the ladies and lords,
set with fat chords
in modern English.
