Lyrics to the song The Fall of Mr Fifths by the band Why?

Just another Sunday
Paddle-boat ride
on a man-made lake
with another lady stranger.
If I remain lost and die on a cross,
at least I wasn't born in a manger.
I can sense, somewhere right
now I'm being prayed for.
Seems like I always arrive
at the same shore
from where my sails set
maybe with one less lady
than my vessel left with.
Is that a threat?

Oh, I've stayed scarce
this past year, yes.
But be assured in unrest:
I'm unavoidable, like death
this Christmas. Is this twisted?
Why be upset? I never said I
didn't have syphilis,
Miss Listless -- Hard like the
bricks I pound my fists with.
I mean, she's hard like the bricks
that I pound with my fists.
This is "The fall of Mr. Fifths,
forged for the hordes
and the ladies and lords,
set with fat chords
in modern English.

Eskimo Snow lyrics

All my words for sadness
Like eskimo snow on unmanned crosses
All planted in threes
In a field for living trees
Are hummed as prayers in secret
And sung through speakers in rooms for people to hear it
Even when I'm wasted and numb
With the words for good wine on a philistine's tongue
And I'm under something black and thicker
Than a sheet for ghosts or the first feet of snow 
That old, that old clouds yield
On the crosses on the chests of dead soldiers in a field
