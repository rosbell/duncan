Lyrics to the song The Fall of Mr Fifths by the band Why?
Just another Sunday
Paddle-boat ride
on a man-made lake
with another lady stranger.
If I remain lost and die on a cross,
at least I wasn't born in a manger.
I can sense, somewhere right
now I'm being prayed for.
Seems like I always arrive
at the same shore
from where my sails set
maybe with one less lady
than my vessel left with.
Is that a threat?
